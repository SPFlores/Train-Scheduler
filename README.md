# Train-Scheduler

##Overview

Check when your train is coming in with an easy to read table. Create a new train to add to the table and see when it arrives. 

##Entry Validation

Time and frequency only accept numbers for entry. Each entry field must have a value that is not an empty string or the form will not go through. 

##It's Here

Currently, if the page is refreshed/loaded when a train is "arriving", it displays "NOW" in the "minutes away" column and, once it has "left" it will display the next arrival time.

##Resources 

I used Moment.JS and their documentation was super helpful. The rest of the messy, messy code is mine. I know I looked at a few Stackoverflow questions but I can't find the actual links of the ones that I ended up using because I was terrible about keeping track of that this time.
